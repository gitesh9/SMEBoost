            whether you're on a video call with a friend, cutting a track, or recording a podcast, the microphones on
            iMac make sure you come through loud, crisp, and clear. The studio-quality three-mic array is designed to
            reduce feedback, so conversations flow more naturally and you interrupt each other less. And beamforming
            technology helps the mics ignore background noise. Which means everyone hears you - not what's going on
            around you.

              fills
              a room: </span>
            the sound system on iMac brings incredible, room-filling audio to any space. Two pairs of force-canceling
            woofers create rich, deep bass without unwanted vibrations. And each pair is balanced with a
            high-performance tweeter. The result is a massive, detailed soundstage that takes your movies, music, and
            more to the next level.

            M1 is the most powerful chip Apple has ever made. macOS Big Sur is an advanced desktop operating system.
            Combined, they take iMac to entirely new levels of performance, efficiency, and security. iMac wakes from
            sleep almost instantly, apps launch in a flash, and the whole system feels fluid, smooth, and snappy. With
            up to 85 percent faster CPU performance and up to two times faster graphics performance than standard
            21.5-inch iMac models, you can use apps like
            Xcode and Affinity Photo to compile code in a fraction of the time or edit photos in real time. And it
            runs
            cool and quiet even while tackling these intense workloads. That's the power of hardware, software, and
            silicon - all designed together.
